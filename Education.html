            I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Development
            at New Mexico State University, where I am dedicated to expanding my
            knowledge and skills in the field. Alongside my ongoing studies, I
            actively engage in supplementary courses to further enhance my
            understanding of key technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
            This proactive approach reflects my commitment to continuous learning
            and mastery of essential tools in software development.
        </p>
    
        <p class="paragraph">
            Complementing my academic pursuits, my self-directed learning
            initiatives have equipped me with practical skills and insights
            that enrich my educational journey. Through a combination of
            coursework and independent study, I am well-positioned to
            leverage my diverse skill set and knowledge base to contribute
            effectively to innovative projects and dynamic teams in the
            tech industry. My educational journey, coupled with hands-on
            experience and a passion for lifelong learning, underscores
            my readiness to excel in the fast-paced and ever-evolving
            field of software development.
